Barkerland has made an alliance with the Republic of Molossia! It is not an official alliance, but it is a friendship of our nations! That is what we wanted.The Republic of Molossia was our founder Beckett Barkerâ€™s biggest inspiration for founding barkerland. We sent a letter to Molossia proposing an alliance, and now we got their response. It says:

>Greetings,
> In reply to your letter, thank you for introducing me to your nation, the Nation of Barkerland. It is an honor. Thank you as well for your interest in establishing a diplomatic relationship with our nation. The Republic of Molossia does not engage in formal recognition or formal diplomacy with other nations instead we prefer friendly informal relations without embassies treaties or alliances. To that end, Molossia is already a friend of Barkerland. Please do not hesitate to ask if we may be of any assistance. I wish all the best to you and the mighty nation of Barkerland 
>
>Regards,
>His Excellency, President Kevin Baugh

It is a great day for Barkerland!
